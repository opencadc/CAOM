Terms from the vocabulary may be used in CAOM instances as values of the 
caom2:Artifact.productType field. Terms in the base vocabulary are to be
used without the URI prefix (e.g. science instead of http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/productType#science)
and (unlike DataLink) without the # symbol.
<hr/>
This vocabulary close mirrors the IVOA <a href="https://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/core">DataLink core</a>
vocabulary. It currently includes the subset of terms that are sensibly "logical file types" and omits
those that are not used in CAOM (those that are relations with other observations or usually on-the-fly
process oputputs like cutouts). The plan is to deprecate this vocabulary and use DataLink core directly.
