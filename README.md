Common Archive Observation Model

This module contains a <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VODML/index.html">VO-DML</a> 
description of the CAOM data model and test code to validate the model using the 
<a href="https://github.com/opencadc/core/tree/master/cadc-vodml">cadc-vodml</a> tools. The 
current version uses some experimental changes (compared to the IVOA proposed recommendation).

The current version is CAOM-2.3; documentation generated from this description:

<a href="http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/">http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/</a>

The next version will be CAOM-2.4: scope is defined and final design should be complete in June 2019. At
this time, all CAOM-2.4 diagrams and documents are preliminary design only. 

Immediate goals:
- add some missing classes to the VO-DML 
- add or update the descriptions of all data model fields in the VO-DML
- improve the HTML generated from the VO-DML
