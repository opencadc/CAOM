Terms from the vocabulary may be used in CAOM instances as values of the 
caom2:Plane.dataProductType field. The terms that are also included in the 
IVOA ObsCore-1.1 dataproduct_type values are to be used without the URI prefix 
(e.g. image instead of http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/DataProductType#image)
while CAOM-specific values must be fully qualified 
(e.g. http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/DataProductType#catalog).
