The Common Archive Observation Model (CAOM) is was originally developed by CADC 
to support unified data discovery and access to a wide range to data collections. 
</p>

<h2>Data Discovery</h2>

<p>Data discovery is supported by the Observation and Plane classes. Together, instances
of these classes describe data products in terms of how data was acquired (telescope, 
instrument, etc) and what data was acquired (position, energy, time, and polarization).</p>

<p>The data discovery parts of the model are designed to work with IVOA data discovery 
protocols (e.g. TAP, SIA, and SSA) that are applicable to observational data and to 
support providing support for IVOA data models (e.g. ObsCore) with minimal extra effort.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>Data access is supported by the Artifact class and, for more specialised cases, the 
Part and Chunk classes. Artifacts are stored data objects (usually files). The structure of
an artifact is described by it part(s) and the data content of the a part is described by
one or more chunk(s). The current model allows for a linear sequence of named parts within an
artifact; this works for some aggregations (e.g. flat tar or zip files) and linear data file formats 
(e.g. FITS) but is not well-suited to hierarchical structures (e.g. directory structures, HDF). 
A chunk is able to describe astronomical data arrays (e.g. spectra, images, cubes), but
cannot describe arbitrary data structures like lists of data objects or tabular data.</p>

<p>The data access parts of the model can be queried via discovery protocols (TAP specifically), 
but the normal use would be to use specialised services that make use of this metadata to 
orchestrate the data access. Specifically, Artifact-Part-Chunk metadata is designed to support
the implementation of IVOA DataLink and SODA services. The Plane-Artifact relation maps
directly to the one or more download links provided by the standard DataLink output; you invoke 
DataLink with a plane identifier and get back URLs for all the artifacts. Addtional metadata in 
the parts and chunks can be used to implement SODA cutout by using the WCS metadata in the chunks to
compute the sky-to-pixel transformations necessary to extract a subset of the pixels from a larger 
data array.</p>

<p>The WCS metadata in the chunks can also be used to compute most of the Plane metadata (position, 
energy, time, and polarization) in a consistent/uniform way. This strategy supports the option to 
shift some responsibility from the data provider to the metadata service provider.</p>
